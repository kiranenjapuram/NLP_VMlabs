    "phosphorus got ignited due to the heat",

    "When a fire brigade arrives, what",

    "(Fig. 4 .6). W ater cools the combustible",
    "material so that its temperature is",

    "temperature. This prevents the fire",
    "from spr eading. W ater vapour s also",
    "surround the combustible material,",
    "helping in cutting of f the supply of air .",
    "So, the fire is extinguished.",
    "You have lear",
    "nt that ther e are three",
    "essential requirements for producing",
    "fire. Can you list these requirements?",
    "These are: fuel, air (to supply",
    "oxygen) and heat (to raise the",
    "temperature of the fuel beyond the",
    "ignition temperature). Fire can be",
    "controlled by removing one or more of",
    "these requirements. The job of a fire",
    "extinguisher is to cut off the supply of",
    "air, or to bring down the temperatur e",
    "of the fuel, or both. Notice that the fuel",
    "Rationalised-2023-24",
    "COMBUSTION  AND FLAME 45The most common fire",
    "extinguisher is water . But",
    "water works only when",
    "things like wood and paper",
    "are on fire. If electrical",
    "equipment is on fire, water",
    "may conduct electricity",
    "and harm those trying to",
    "douse the fir e. W ater is",
    "also not suitable for fires",
    "involving oil and petrol. Do",
    "you recall that water is",
    "heavier than oil? So, it",
    "sinks below the oil, and oil",
    "keeps burning on the top.",
    "For fires involving electrical equipment and inflammable materials like",
    "petrol, carbon dioxide (CO2) is the best extinguisher . CO2, being heavier than",
    "oxygen, covers the fire like a blanket. Since the contact between the fuel and",
    "oxygen is cut off, the fire is controlled. The added advantage of CO2 is that in",
    "most cases it does not harm the electrical equipment.",
    "How do we get the supply of carbon dioxide? It can be stored at high pressure",
    "as a liquid in cylinders. In what form is the LPG stored in cylinders? When",
    "released fr om the cylinder , CO2 expands enor mously in volume and cools down.",
    "So, it not only forms a blanket around the fire, it also brings down the",
    "temperatur e of the fuel. That is why it is an excellent fir e extinguisher . Another",
    "way to get CO2 is to release a lot of dry powder of chemicals like sodium",
    "bicarbonate (baking soda) or potassium bicarbonate. Near the fire, these",
    "chemicals give off CO2.",
    "CAUTION  : Do not handle the gas",
    "stove yourself. Ask your parents",
    "to help.",
